The essays comprising this book selected mostly from Warren Buffett letters to the shareholders of Berkshire 
provide a guide to 
fundamental business analysis and an approach to wise investing A central point that Buffett makes is that good 
investors rather than focusing on the market should identify good businesses attempt to buy them at good prices 
and hold them for the long term Buffett has done just this in his management of Berkshire
Disagreeing with the dogma popular in recent decades known as modern finance theory 
that holds that market prices efficiently express business values Buffett instead argues that the market sets prices
 in a manic depressive manner A good investor learns to insulate himself from market emotions and to make a 
 distinction between market price and intrinsic value Such an investor will not be bothered by such nonsense as a high beta 
 measure of volatility academic theorists use as a risk factor and warning but will understand that volatility 
 provides investment opportunities and will use market drops to make good purchases Eventually the market will 
 confirm his good sense
As the CEO of Berkshire originally a textile company Buffett has succeeded hugely by purchasing all of or 
significant portions of good businesses and then left talented managers alone to operate them His business centered 
rather than market oriented approach has involved supporting the development over time of these companies Buffett 
eschews the popular notion in investing of diversification contending rather that an investor should focus on what 
he can understand
Furthermore a good investor needs to make decisions by regarding a business opportunity on its own terms and 
in its specific environment These principles he demonstrates were unfortunately forgotten in the mania of the 
1980s and 1990s during which junk and zero coupon bonds became popular investment modes and stock prices got 
out of sync with values bringing financial disaster for many The merger movements of these years especially 
damaged shareholders in the acquiring companies because the mergers often involved undervalued stock of these 
companies being exchanged for overvalued stock of the acquired companies
For Buffett acquisitions provide an example of but one of many ways in which the actions of managements have 
conflicted with shareholder interests He demonstrates in these essays that as a CEO he sees an identity 
between his interests and those of Berkshire shareholders While most company heads would wish their stock to 
be sold at the highest possible price Buffett wants the shares of Berkshire to maintain a close relationship 
with their intrinsic values; in this way shareholders should receive profits that represent company results 
over the period of their holdings Furthermore under Buffett leadership Berkshire avoided stock splits which 
he considers mainly as marketing tools
In the last chapters of the book Buffett explores both the value and limitations of corporate accounting and 
laments how pressures to report a profit have damaged accounting integrity The focus by companies on their stock 
prices antagonistic to Buffett approach has produced target prices that have encouraged accounting manipulations 
The argument of many executives that stock options should not be considered a cost represents another pressure 
tending to corrupt honest accounting As a way to allow a more effective evaluation of a business finances Buffett 
offers the concept of look through earnings that will credit both retained and distributed earnings 
Above all these essays provide good examples showing there is no substitute for honest clear and full 
disclosure in business
