Buffett demonstrates that in making acquisitions companies commonly reduce the wealth of
 their shareholders because the exchange is an unequal one in which the acquirer gives
  up $2 to receive $1 in value The often-missed irony Buffett points out is that were 
  the buying company to sell its entire business it could likely get full intrinsic value 
  However in making an acquisition which in fact involves a partial sale of itself via the 
  issuing of shares it can get a price no higher than what the market assigns it 
  which is frequently lower than intrinsic value In regard to acquisitions which illustrate 
  but one way that a CEO goals are often at odds with the interests of shareholders
   Buffett differs from the practices of most corporate heads Berkshire strongly prefers
    to use cash instead of stock in buying companies
Unusually for an acquiring company Berkshire seeks to purchase company
 from owners whom it wishes to retain as managers and who are promised autonomy 
 to run their businesses Buffett makes it clear that he especially prefers to buy from 
 owners who have lovingly built businesses and will be most happy continuing to operate them 
 freed from having to deal with the various enticements to which generating excess cash would 
 have subjected them
