In an extended Owner Manual provided for Berkshire shareholders the first selection in this chapter Buffett 
summarizes his basic business principles elaborated in much greater detail throughout the book As the chief manager
 of Berkshire he stresses here his role as a partner with the shareholders and asserts that his interest is identical 
 with theirs the long term progress of the companies Berkshire holds Buffett argues for the need for full and fair 
 reporting by management CEOs he says should avoid predictions since these invariably create targets that lead to 
 unwholesome maneuvering with regard to earnings statements
Buffett addresses the often difficult relationship between boards and CEOs it is all too common for inadequate people
 in the latter positions to be tolerated indefinitely because performance standards for their jobs rarely exist 
 in contrast with that of subordinate positions and because directors often are incapable of or unwilling to make 
 needed changes These sorts of problems generally are not found in the companies Buffett has assembled for Berkshire 
 companies led by talented managers he admires whom he wishes to leave alone to do their jobs
Managers of most public corporations in making charitable donations Buffett points out never solicit the 
opinion of their owner shareholders At Berkshire he has devised a unique model that allows shareholders to 
designate charitable recipients in a way that is included within the company tax deduction allowances 
Another common problem in corporate America that Buffett has attempted to solve is how stock options benefit 
executives in a manner detached from their real job performance For managers of Berkshire companies 
Buffett has designed an incentive compensation system that seeks to provide rewards on the basis of results 
achieved rather than stock price
