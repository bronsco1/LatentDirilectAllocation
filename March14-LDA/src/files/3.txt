The key to successful investing Buffett posits is to purchase shares in good businesses at 
times when market prices are at a large discount from business values This might seem 
commonsense but Buffett points out that most institutional investors in the 1970s under 
the spell of business school professors who contended that markets were totally efficient 
in establishing stock prices considered underlying business values to be of little importance
Buffett uses the example of the hypothetical Mr Market a creation of his teacher Ben Graham 
A manicdepressive Mr Market spews out price quotations that reflect his severe emotional 
pathology A headache for many investors this is good news for the wise investor able to 
insulate himself from these contagious emotions and make investment decisions based on 
the real values of businesses he can understand Following this approach such investors 
will find that times of declining stock prices provide the best opportunities Eventually 
Buffett knows the market will validate their decisions
Investment decisions rather than being based on opinions about shortterm market prospects 
instead should reflect judgments about longterm prospects of specific companies What makes 
sense for a business owner is the same as what is smart for a shareholder: holding onto a 
piece of an outstanding business with tenacity According the name investors 
to institutions that trade actively he writes is like calling someone who repeatedly 
engages in onenight stands a romantic While Buffett concedes that he might sometimes 
make slightly higher profits were he an active trader he justifies his holding strategy 
in part on the value of the trusting relationships he has formed with his talented managers
When it comes to conventional portfolio theory Buffett disagrees with the popular notion 
of diversification in investing arguing rather that investors should focus on what they 
understand The overuse of betas as measures of risk in stock purchasing he considers 
ridiculous since it is exactly the volatility of stocks that provides opportunities for 
investors who have taken the trouble to determine the intrinsic value of companies For 
Buffett the idea of value investing is redundant His definition of the best businesses 
to own are those that over an extended period can employ large amounts of capital at 
very high rates of return In acquiring such whether they are complete companies or 
large share portions he insists on the importance of a margin of safety: the price paid 
should not exceed value
