In contrast to CEOs who wish their company stock to trade at the highest possible price 
Buffett wants Berkshire shares to sell at close to their intrinsic value so that holders 
of shares for any particular period will benefit according to the company business 
results during that period To make real this intention he has sought to attract shareholders 
who have a long-term perspective rather than a short-term market-oriented strategy
Another area in which Berkshire has diverged from common corporate practices involves 
dividend policy For each dollar retained by a corporation Buffett believes that at 
least one dollar of market value should be created for the owners Berkshire has never 
paid a dividend Buffett believes that a major reason for its success has been his ability 
to deploy effectively the cash generated by Berkshire component businesses resulting 
in the company stock prices increasing at rates well in excess of market averages It 
is all too common elsewhere for corporate managers to invest in subsidiary businesses that 
may inflate their egos but often provide poor returns In Buffett opinion managers 
should put themselves in the place of shareholders with regard to payout decisions 
He specifically applauds those managements which decide to purchase their own company
 shares when available at prices less than the intrinsic value
In keeping with the importance of maintaining a rational stock price and a business
rather than market orientation Berkshire has never split its stock Finally in 1996 
Buffett did authorize the issuance of Class B shares with 1/30 the rights of the existing shares
 mainly to stop Wall St operators who had created clones of Berkshire with investment 
 trusts that attracted buyers who did not understand Berkshire business philosophy
